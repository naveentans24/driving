<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-12">
<p>Driving on German roads can be flexible and full of freedom. You can drive fast, fast as most Germans do. And we Germans love our cars. This is not surprising if you consider that the Autobahn highway system lets you explore your pace. But this is a country that takes its driving with zeal and earnest, which is nowhere more evident than on the roads and preset driving expectations. You will have to drive the German style. The German style demands an out-and-out driver, fewer traffic offences and of course less loss of lives. In fact, a random survey will reveal that most motorists consider themselves either as “very good” or “quite good”. Zealous drivers. The reality is that Germany has witnessed considerable decrease of deaths resulting from road accidents, and of the 43 million car drivers, only 16 percent of them have accumulated points in Flensburg (Punkte in Flensburg)</p>

<p>The Punkte in Flensburg system is used to record points on your driving license at a place called Flensburg when found guilty of a driving offence, ranging from over speeding to convictions that come with driving bans. A newly-certified driver starts with a clean German driver’s license and accumulates points on every traffic violation. Furthermore, more points are recorded if the individual commits an offence that is deemed bigger. If the individual accumulates up to 8 points, the driving license is revoked permanently. In practice motorists should already be trying avoid Punkte in Flensburg as soon as they get their licenses. While a margin of 1-4 may seem harmless and sustainable at first, chances of reaching the 8-point threshold may sometimes be sudden. With this in consideration and in order to avoid the possible revocation of your driving license, it is important to be an out-and-out driver with no entry in the Flensburg account. Always stay out of trouble.</p>
</div>
</div>
								
										
						<dl class="accordion accordion-faq m-t-5">
						
												
							<dt>01. Foreigners also accumulate Flensburg points</dt>
							<dd><p>You’re not helping yourself if you think being a foreigner exempts you from the Flensburg register. Foreigner or otherwise, the law does not discriminate. Those subjected to this system for the first time might feel like they’re in a foreign country with weird rules and unrealistic driving expectations, but that is the law in Germany. Staying out of trouble can be helpful at this very early stage, especially if you are to consider that foreigners are liable to stiffer penalties compared to the locals.</p>
                            <ul>
                            There are several scenarios that foreigners in possession of German driver’s license may encounter:

                            <li>You’re fined and the penalty notice forwarded to your country as well. Failure to settle the fine leads to legal proceedings, at least in the EU.</li>
                            <li>Breach of certain traffic laws such as running red lights may lead to temporary bans that could go up to three months.</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>Anyone defying the bewildering and, to many, weird laws of traffic in the country is subjected to the German schedule of fines. It consists of all traffic violations as per the law, as well as the fines they attract. It also prescribes likely penalties and Flensburg points for varied offences, including driving bans and how long they are supposed to last.</p>

                           <p>In this example, the individual can also lose his or her country’s driving license. European countries have the European Car and Driving License Information System (EUCARIS) which allows easy exchange of data regarding car registrations, driving licenses, and the associated personal data. The chances of being banned in your country are therefore inevitable.</p>

                           <p>The Punkte in Flensburg system punishes intoxicated drivers especially hard. Whereas you need to accumulate 8 points for your license to be revoked, drunk driving may lead to automatic revocation. A medical-psychological examination (Medizinisch-Psychologische Untersuchung) to demonstrate a more dedicated and careful driving style by the offender in future, is needed to redeem the license. But it is often very difficult to get one.</p> </dd>
							
											
												
							<dt>02. Revocation of a driving licenses</dt>
							<dd><p>There are a number of ways in which an individual can end up with a suspended or revoked driving permit in Germany. For a temporary ban, for example, the individual is suspended for up to three months after which the license can be regained. It also applies to valid foreign driver’s permits.</p>

                            <p>Regardless of the duration of your stay in the country -as a tourist or otherwise- leaving Germany without meeting the specified terms does not nullify the driving ban. The individual can be convicted of the offence if he or she re-enters the country, and slapped with a fine or prison sentence of up to one year.</p>

                            <p>Issuance of permanent driving bans is regulated by the German criminal code under section 69b. This law provides for revocation of preliminary permission to operate a vehicle in Germany, where it is not possible to regain the driving license during the period prescribed by the authorities.</p>

                            <p>For citizens of European countries, their driver’s permits are sent to relevant authorities in their respective countries. Alternatively, indications of the ban can be made on the license itself, squashing any chances of the individual operating a vehicle in Germany. Notably, driving a vehicle with such a license ceases to be a traffic offence and becomes criminal, subjecting the guilty individual to prosecution as per the laws of Germany.</p></dd>
							
											
												
							<dt>03. Who needs a German driving license?</dt>
							<dd>As a foreigner, you may need to drive in Germany and be licensed. But because every country’s laws are different, you will have to comply with Germany’s unique laws. If you hold a driving license that was issued outside of Germany, it is advisable to confirm whether you need to convert it to a German driving license. This is because Germany accepts foreign driver’s licenses for the first few months of the individual’s stay in the country.

                            <p>Citizens of EU countries, read no further; your driving license is absolutely valid in Germany. On the other hand, Canadians, Americans and South Africans can easily trade in their licenses. But let's start with the basics. Wherever your country, you can drive lawfully in Germany with your home license for the first six months. And if you're certain to stay in Germany for less than a year, you can apply for extension to cover your stay provided you produce your home license and proofs of extension like plane tickets and job contracts.</p>

                            <p>If you'll be staying in Germany for more than a year, however, you will need a license to drive in the country after the six months have elapsed. Citizens of countries and American states that have license exchange agreements with Germany have up to three years to swap their licenses, after which they begin from scratch like the locals.</p>

                            <p>But if you’re from a non-EU country with a license recognized by Germany, you will need to prove residency of at least 185 days in line with German laws.</p></dd>
							
											
												
							<dt>04. Driving permits outside EU countries</dt>
							<dd><p>If you’re a citizen of a country outside the European Union, and therefore you cannot translate your home driver's license into a German driver's license, we advise that you consult at your nearest admissions office. There is likelihood that you will have to take both theoretical and practical driving tests to qualify for a valid German driver’s license after staying in the country for one year.</p></dd>
							
											
												
							<dt>05. Speed limits on German roads</dt>
							<dd>
<p>Like in most European countries, German authorities limit their motorists to speeds of 50 km/h while in urban areas and 100 km/h in rural areas. Surprisingly though, the German Autobahn (motorways) are intended to be without speed limits, with just a recommended speed of 130 km/h &ndash; unless otherwise indicated through a speed limit sign or by means of an Autobahn lcd panel which in this case takes precedence over a standard metal sign.</p>

<p>The unrestricted speed limits have fueled heat up debates and controversial discussions in the last few years. A drive by the environmentalist Green party of Germany to put in place a national speed limit has not been fruitful, with the environmentalist party citing ecological hazards like air pollution which has caused widespread Waldsterben (forest destruction). Whereas a number of Autobahns in forest areas have been imposed with new speed limits, a national limit remains unlikely.</p>

<p>Conspicuously, some stretches of the Autobahn &ndash; like areas of construction, accident-prone spots and junctions &ndash; have regulated speeds. Some urban areas have limits and on the best estimate, 12 percent of the whole network of 13,000km is devoid of speed limits.</p>

<p>With regard to speed limits, certain stretches of the Autobahn have speed limit signs because of numerous merging cars and for the purpose of noise reduction. This is usually enforced much more strictly both by police cars and speed cameras. It is the law that speed cameras take head shots so that German authorities can easily identify the over speeding driver. Tickets are sent to the car owner and in cases where the driver is not the owner, the car owner is not liable for the speeding offence. But still, the owner is expected to help the authorities in identifying the driver.</p>

<p>Traffic offenses as per the German driving laws are varied. Depending on the violation, you may accumulate points (Punkte in Flensburg), pay fines and even face revocation of the driving license as summarized below:<br></p><p>

							<dt>06. Violation of parking laws</dt>
							<dd><p>Many foreigners fall foul of Germany’s parking regulations because of incomprehensive understanding. This is understandable if you consider the numerous parking laws as stipulated in the StVO (German driving laws). You’ll no doubt want to park your car while on a trip in one of the towns, but did you know that in Germany a car is considered parked if it doesn’t move for at least three minutes? Read on.</p> 
							<ul>You are not allowed to park in the following situations:

                            <li>5m closer to pedestrian crossings or side roads</li>
                            <li>By the kerbside in the direction of oncoming traffic</li>
                            <li>15m closer to a bus stop or areas for public vehicles</li>
                            <li>On a bicycle lane</li>
                            <li>Any place with prohibited parking sign</li>
                            <li>Within 10m of traffic lights</li>

                            <p>After finding a place to park, you must pay immediately. Like anywhere else, the pay and display ticket machines operate on the principle of ‘pay and display’.</p></dd>
							
											
												
							<dt>07. Safety precautions in the car</dt>
							<dd><p>Safety within the car, just like outside, can be a problem, but all you need to do is to take the everyday sensible precautions and follow some rudimentary safety rules.</p>
							<ul>Your car will no doubt be subjected to surprise traffic checks to inspect whether you have:

                            <li>A first aid kit</li>
                            <li>A reflective vest</li>
                            <li>A warning triangle</li></ul>

                            <p>Besides, the condition of tyres will also be inspected to confirm that they meet the minimum threshold of 1.6mm tread depth as per the German law. Winter tyres are also mandatory depending on weather conditions.</p>
                            <p>The seatbelt law is very clear: all drivers, including coaches must wear their seatbelts while on moving vehicles. Individuals found guilty of this offense are liable to a fine of €30. However, whether or not you’re obligated by law to wear a seatbelt, it’s always prudent to put it on. Research findings have revealed that seatbelts would save up to 75 percent of lives and 90 percent of injuries caused by people involved in road accidents who weren’t wearing them.</p> </dd>
							
											
												
							<dt>08. Drunk driving and drug driving</dt>
							<dd><h4>Drunk driving</h4>
                            <p>Under German law, driving under influence of alcohol and other drugs is proved by weakening of normal faculties, and unacceptable blood alcohol or breath alcohol level of at least 0.5 mg/ml. The penalties upon conviction are really punitive regardless of the method used in proving guilt. A country of diversity, Germany has equally startling cultures. You may end up being arrested by your fellow motorists for being intoxicated. Clearly, Germans love their beer – acclaimed as some of the finest in the world - but they prize in responsibility. There exist stringent laws to curb drunk driving. Harsher than the actual drugs, with fines of between €500 and €1500, their penalties sometimes come in the form of extended driving bans. Marijuana, specifically, is prohibited in Germany which may not only lead to conviction but also driving bans and accumulation of several points.</p>

                            <h4>Fines for cyclists and pedestrians</h4>
                            <p>Like motorists, many cyclists disregard traffic rules which are equally subject to penalties. In general, the biggest problem for most cyclists in Germany are police control points. If you run into any of these controls without a reflector, faulty brakes and a generally ill-equipped bike, you will get into trouble with the police. The brakes, reflectors and other nitty gritties are of particular importance to the authorities.</p>

                            <p>Always avoid trouble By law, a cyclist whose bike lacks proper lighting can be slapped with a fine of up to €25, while pedestrians are fined a warning fee of €5 if they cross against the red light. Cyclists on the other hand accumulate a point and are liable to a fine of €60 for the same offense.Abiding by these laws should make driving in Germany safe and pleasurable. Before you head out to your car or bike ensure you’ve got enough knowledge and driving ability, because the last thing you want to spoil is your stay and driving escapades in Germany.</p></dd>
